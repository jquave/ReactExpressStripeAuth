React boilerplate with live reload, scss, and not much else.

Made because every other boilerplate makes way too many assumptions.


## Usage

### Install dependencies
```
yarn
```

### Run a dev server with hot reload
```
yarn serve
```

That's it.

Does not include redux, feel free to add it in a fork and name it SuperComplicatedReactBoilerplate ðŸ”¥
